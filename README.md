The A* search algorithm is a popular method used to find the shortest path between two points in a graph or grid. It is majorly used in computer science and artificial intelligence.

The A* algorithm works by combining the features of two other algorithms: Dijkstra's algorithm, which finds the shortest path by exploring all possible routes, and the Best-First Search algorithm, which uses a guess (heuristic) to quickly find the target. By using a heuristic, the A* algorithm can find the shortest path effectively.
